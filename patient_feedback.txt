Unfortunately I was unable to receive assistance. I waited for more than an hour, without any satisfaction, the poor secretary didn't know what to say, just that a previous procedure was delayed. It's complicated, there's a lack of organization in their schedules, they want to earn a lot, so they schedule one thing after another and can't handle everyone, unless they keep the patient waiting. However, the doctor's time is just as important as that of his patients.
